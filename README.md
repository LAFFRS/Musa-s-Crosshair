# Crosshair Customizer

**Crosshair Customizer** is a lightweight desktop application designed to help gamers create and display a customizable crosshair overlay while playing games. It allows you to adjust the crosshair size, toggle visibility with a hotkey, and provide a unique user experience. This tool is non-intrusive and works by displaying a simple, drawn crosshair over your screen, giving you complete control over its appearance.

## Features
- **Customizable Crosshair**: Adjust the size of your crosshair based on your preference.
- **Hotkey Toggle**: Set a hotkey to easily toggle the crosshair visibility in-game.
- **Modern Interface**: A sleek, modern user interface with vibrant colors for an enjoyable setup experience.
- **Text-to-Speech Greeting**: Upon launching, the app greets the user by their chosen player name using text-to-speech technology.

## How It Works
The application uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech functionality. The crosshair is drawn directly onto the screen using basic geometric shapes, ensuring the application remains lightweight and unobtrusive.

### Key Features:
- The crosshair is drawn using `tkinter`'s Canvas widget.
- The app allows the user to adjust the size of the crosshair and toggle its visibility using a customizable hotkey.
- The user interface is intuitive and modern, designed with light and dark blues and purples for a pleasant experience.

## Installation

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (typically pre-installed with Python)
- `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech functionality (installable via pip)
